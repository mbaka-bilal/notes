Facebook App Install Ads (app promotion campaigns)
-------------------------
Facebook app install ads is a way for us to advertise
our applications on facebook. It allows us to use 
their api and sdk to target, which gives us access
to their algorithm, allowing us to advertise to 
people who have a higher probability of performing
a specifice action such as

i. tap the ad
ii. install the app

and we are charged based on these things, for example
for taps we are charged based on the number of users
that taps on the ad.

with the sdk we also have access to track in app user
event such as if a user adds to cart e.t.c. On the 
facebook ad manager platform we can view various 
metrics.

why do we need the sdk?

You don't need to register your app or implement the 
SDK in order to run ads using the app promotion objective, 
but your ads will automatically optimize for link clicks 
rather than app installs. In addition, your campaign will 
not track any installs that happen as a result of your ads 
unless your app is registered and the SDK is correctly 
implemented.

then create an app and add a platform, to get the
key hashes

-keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
| openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
