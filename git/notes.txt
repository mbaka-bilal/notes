> git branch //see list of local branches
> git branch -r //see list of remote branches
> git branch -a //see all remotes and local branches
> git checkout -b branch_name //create a branch and checkout
> git checkout --track origin/my-branch-name //checkout to a remote branch
> git merge my-branch-name //merge another branch into the current branch
> git push origin --delete my-branch-name //Delete a remote branch
> git branch -d my-branch-name //Delete a local branch

The -d option only deletes the branch if it has already been merged. 
The -D option is a shortcut for --delete --force, which deletes 
the branch irrespective of its merged status.
> git branch -D my-branch-name //force delete a local branch
